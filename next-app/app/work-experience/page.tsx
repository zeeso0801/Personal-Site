        <p>
          As a coop in the Gulfstream applied aerodynamics group, I was exposed to the full gamut of industry methods and applications for aerodynamic analysis. Some of the projects I got to work on included tool development, CFD solver validation, supplemental type certification, production OML discrepancy analysis, 14 CFR 25 Appendix O ice accretion, winglet development analysis, and Gulfstream&apos;s submission for NASA&apos;s 5th High Lift Prediction Workshop (HLPW5).

        <p>
          While in the Gulfstream Acoustics and Vibrations group, I updated the Cabin Noise Survey program used to collect and analyze acoustic data from every aircraft that leaves the factory. I fixed bugs and added features that allow engineers to compare individual aircraft data to fleet averages to find outliers and narrow down discrepancies. I also conducted multiple acoustics lab tests including vendor material validation and acoustic sampling of prototype components.

        <p>
          In the Flight Test Powerplant and Mechanical Systems group, I audited the flight test instrumentation database to confirm engine recording definitions and helped write developmental flight test reports documenting results for new software testing on the G500/G600 programs.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Simulation and Software Coop</h2>
        <p>
          During my time in the Simulation and Software group, I pre-ran human factors test points and troubleshot issues in simulators and iron-birds in preparation for FAA demonstrations. I also adapted regression testing software for legacy labs and wrote scripts to automate administrative tasks such as license distribution and system status checking.
